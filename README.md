# Red vs Blue
A singleplayer 2D RTS game where the player takes the control of units in the battle of two AIs

Currently WIP and very early in development, expected to be somewhat finished in a few years

This is mostly a bit of fun, as well as programming and Unity practice for myself as improving my OOP principles and optimization techniques

## To do
- Tile maps, currently I need to make maps by placing game objects at certain positions which takes time thus why I only have one map currently
- Map selection
- Team selection
- Better sprites and textures
- More units and buildings
- Air units
- Campaign mode
- Skirmish mode
- Code improvements, some the code is from certain years ago and could be improved and neatened up
